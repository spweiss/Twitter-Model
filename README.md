# Twitter Model

This is a web model for Twitter developed in Ruby on Rails according to MVC and
REST architectural models. It incorporates a full suite of features, including:
* Users (with unidirectional following, administrator privileges, and user indices)
* Microposts (with news feeds, pagination, and image attachment)
* Sign-up and log-in (with email verification, password reset, and SSL encryption)

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```

```
$ rails server
```
